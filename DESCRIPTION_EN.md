[h1]⚡ SITREP: OPERATION "ACUTE STRESS DISORDER"[/h1]

[b]Soldier, welcome to Sefrou-Ramal.[/b] Forget standard rules of engagement. Here, there is no defined frontline. No guaranteed safe zone. You are not fighting an army; you are fighting paranoia itself.

In this asymmetric theater of operations, [b]danger is everywhere and nowhere[/b]. Your ability to distinguish a civilian from a deadly threat will be the only thing standing between you and "Game Over".

[hr]

[h2]🎯 WHAT AWAITS YOU:[/h2]

[b]1. THE ENEMY IS INVISIBLE[/b]
Forget distinct uniforms. The enemy blends into the crowd. Thanks to a dynamic conversion system, any civilian can turn into an insurgent at any moment. That harmless passerby watching you? They could pull a weapon and gun you down in a second.
[list]
[*] [b]Constant Moral Dilemma:[/b] Shooting first is a war crime. Waiting for positive ID can be fatal. Do you have the nerves for this?
[/list]

[b]2. THE TERRAIN IS MINED[/b]
Never lower your guard. The ground itself is your enemy. Anti-personnel mines are scattered randomly across the roads of the map.

[b]3. UNPREDICTABLE CHAOS[/b]
The mission generates its own emergencies. You don't choose the timing; you endure the chaos of the battlefield:
[list]
[*] [b]Civilian Protection:[/b] Protect the population amidst the crossfire. Collateral damage is not tolerated. (Global mission)
[*] [b]EOD Under Pressure:[/b] Unmarked bombs to locate by sound... Beep... Beep... Beep...
[*] [b]Extraction Under Fire:[/b] Secure and extract hostages via helicopter.
[*] [b]Tense Negotiations:[/b] Meet with local warlords. They might give you intel... betray you instantly... or be betrayed by their own men.
[*] [b]Terrorist Attack:[/b] Intervene urgently to stop a massacre of civilians by infiltrated insurgents.
[/list]

[b]4. TOTAL IMMERSION[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]"EAGLE" Logistics Support:[/b] Have vehicles delivered by airlift directly to your position.
[*] [b]Living Atmosphere:[/b] Dynamic weather, day/night choice, and spatialized Calls to Prayer (Ezan) for absolute audio immersion.
[*] [b]Squad Spirit:[/b] Recruit your "Brothers in Arms" (AI) or deploy in Co-op to cover your six.
[/list]
