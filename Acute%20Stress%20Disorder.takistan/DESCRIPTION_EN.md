[b]Type:[/b] Asymmetric Warfare / COOP / Sandbox

[hr]

[h1]SITUATION[/h1]
Welcome to Sefrou-Ramal. You are deployed in a highly volatile zone. This is asymmetric warfare at its peak: hostile civilians, mined roads, and total unpredictability.

[h1]OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Terrorist Attack:[/b] Emergency intervention required. Stop an active massacre of civilians by infiltrated insurgents.
[*] [b]Bomb Defusal:[/b] Locate and defuse hidden IEDs and explosives before they detonate.
[*] [b]Hostage Extraction:[/b] Locate and evacuate hostages under heavy fire via helicopter.
[*] [b]Negotiations:[/b] Meet with random local warlords. Outcomes vary: valuable intel, sudden betrayal, or an ambush against your informant.
[*] [b]Civilian Protection:[/b] A persistent global objective. You must minimize collateral damage in an active war zone.
[/list]

[h1]KEY FEATURES[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Invisible Enemy:[/b] Trust no one. Civilians can turn hostile at any moment. Insurgents do not wear distinct uniforms.
[*] [b]Mined Roads:[/b] Watch your step and your driving. IEDs are scattered randomly across the road network.
[*] [b]Immersive Atmosphere:[/b] Dynamic weather systems and immersive calls to prayer set the tone of the environment.
[*] [b]Logistical Support:[/b] Call in vehicle drops via helicopter (Support Eagle) directly to your location in the field.
[*] [b]Squad Management:[/b] Recruit AI soldiers to build your squad in Singleplayer, or play in COOP with friends.
[*] [b]Infinite Replayability:[/b] Fully randomized experience. Enemy positions, objectives, and threats change every time you launch the mission.

[h1]EXTRACTION & ENDLESS MODE[/h1]
An extraction helicopter is scheduled to arrive between [b]30 and 45 minutes[/b] into the operation. 
However, the mission is [b]not time-limited[/b].
[i]If players choose to ignore the extraction and remain in the AO, the mission continues endlessly.[/i]
